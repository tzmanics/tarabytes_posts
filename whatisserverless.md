Chances are you've heard the term serverless and are even using some form of ‚ú®serverless magic‚ú® yourself. But software is confusing, and software terms even more so. When I started [learning about the JAMstack](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/10/30/whats-angular-in-the-jamstack-it-sounds-delicious/) it threw me for a loop when people would talk about not using servers and then also talk about [serverless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing). **Spoiler alert**: these would be opposites because serverless computing _actually_ uses servers. In hopes of clarifying one mystery I wanted to write a quick post on what serverless really means.

## What it is, tho

> [Serverless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing): is a cloud-computing execution model in which the cloud provider runs the server, and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. (via [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing))

As you can see, serverless is just a way of handling _how_ you are _using servers_. Instead of handling all the infrastructure and server operations yourself you're relying on a cloud provider. The cloud provider can help you with [scaling](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2014/04/09/explain-vertical-horizontal-scaling-cloud/), [server provisioning](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisioning_(telecommunications)#Server_provisioning>), [capacity provisioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_management), [patching](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)>), and more (depending on the provider). This takes a lot of operational burden off of your team and can help solve potential problems like slow response due to bottleneck or expensive unused overhead. Like most [JAMstack best practices](https://jamstack.org/best-practices/), serverless provides a way to delgate more tasks so the dev team can spend more time innovating and creating features, not focusing on maintenance.

Why the term "serverless" was chosen is mind boggling but using such a ridiculous name has gotten it a good amount of buzz. I mean, I had _just_ gotten my family to realize that "the cloud" is just servers and now they throw "serverless" at me. My family thinks I'm part of some conspiracy theory now. Thanks, internet.

## It's All About the Money

Although serverless is technically an execution model, you're mostly talking about a service. To add to the confusion pile, is the way that service is priced. Yay! Ok, not really 'yay' ü§ë. Most cloud providers will charge based on the resources used, for instance how much capacity is used or how many times something is executed. A nice part about this pricing model is that most providers won't charge you if you aren't taking up a lot of memory or executing code a ton. So, although it's great to be able to hand your server reins over to a cloud provider you'll want to understand what's going on to avoid a financial [foot gun](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun).

## Key Takeaways

- serverless uses servers
- cloud providers handle the server operations
- pricing is usually quite confusing
- naming things is hard

I hope this help shed some light onto one of the key elements of the JAMstack. The awesome [Jason Lengstorf](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf) has a whole series coming out this #JAMuary to help you wrap your mind around serverless functions. Keep your ear to the ground for that. In the meantime here are some other resources to peruse. Happy coding!üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
