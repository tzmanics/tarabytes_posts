# An Introduction to the Temporal Proposal

The title of this proposal, temporal, may not ring any bells but does JavaScript `Date`? More than likely, that rings warning bells if you've spent a lot of time trying to manage different timezones, or ðŸ˜° parse anything having to do with `Date`. Time is hard, but it is especially hard in JavaScript. Unfortunately, things haven't gone too smoothly since Brendan Eich copied the `java.Util.Date` date implementation during his 10-day creating-javascript-spree (you can read all about it in [Maggie's awesome post from 2017](https://maggiepint.com/2017/04/09/fixing-javascript-date-getting-started/)). Now we have the `temporal` module to the rescue, thanks to [Maggie Pint](https://github.com/maggiepint), [Philipp Dunkel](https://github.com/pipobscure), [Matt Johnson](https://github.com/mj1856), and [Brian Terlson](https://github.com/bterlson)!

The proposal is [currently at stage 2](https://github.com/tc39/proposals#stage-2), which is the draft stage. Although it *technically* has two more stages to go, I'm very excited about this proposal. Let me give you a quick overview so you can get stoked too!

>Here is the [TC39 Process](https://tc39.es/process-document/) for proposals for reference.
