# The Hope of a Failure

I am a very successful person. I am very successful at a very challenging, niche career. I write code and then I deliver talks on it in front of audiences of thousands around the world. I even received a promotion and raise just yesterday. Today though, I got my period. I was not successful in getting pregnant. I failed at it, again.

That is not a very empowering way of saying it. It's not a motivating, logical, or kind way of putting it but that's the way I feel. I feel like a failure. I feel dissappointed and, in turn, dissappointed in myself. I feel tired. I feel impatient.

I'm annoyed with how much of my life has been waiting on the outcome of blood. When I was in my 20's I had moments I was so scared my period wouldn't come. I really wish someone would have taught me about ovulation cycles, a lot of stress could have been avoided. At 33 I started hoping to not see blood, month after month. I also finally learned about ovulation cycles, which, at this point, caused more stress. 

At 34 I begged for the blood to stop. I was in New Orleans for 10 days on a speaking engagement staying in an AirBnB I now fondly call my pied-à-terror. It was 2 weeks after my first ever, positive pregnancy test. The first sign of bleeding was worrisome, but when I woke up and my breasts were no longer sore, I knew it was over. Unfortunately, the bleeding wasn't. After a night of constant sobbing and terrified google searches, I found solace in learning how frequent miscariages were. The next night, I drank a lot of bourbon, a lot (side note: thinning your blood, doesn't help the bleeding, now I know). 

I continued to bleed on and off for a month. I bled through the rest of the conference in New Orleans (the owners of my pied-à-terror definitely thought I killed someone). I bled through the most amazing lady's trip to Mexico that I suprised my Mom with for her golden birthday the week after the conference (no, tequila also does not help with the cessation of bleeding). I bled all the way up until I ovulated again.   

When the doctor doing my miscarriage follow-up told me to be careful and wear a condom because it looked like I was in my luteal phase, I failed to heed her advice. I didn't want to. I failed on purpose that time. I was filled with hope and fear when I saw my second, positive pregnancy test. The fear didn't ever really subside, but changed into a differnt fear of failure at each point of the pregnancy all the way until the day he was born. I had a nice break from fear when I was only filled with love and joy, finally being able to hold him in my arms.

Now, eventhough I failed again, after months of failing, he reminds me there's hope. My friends who have had even more challenges than I could even fathom, remind me there's hope. So, yes, in life there are failures. In this case, I'm hopeful, because I have a chance to fail until I succeed.

Periods are still annoying though.
