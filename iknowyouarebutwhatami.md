# I Know You Are But What Am I?

I recently joined a new team and my manager prompted me with the 5 year question. There was nothing intimidating about it on the surface. She's an amazing, compassionate, smart and funny person. There was no pressure, no time limit, no expectations, from her. I, on the other hand, took one second to think of where I wanted to be in 5 years, drew a blank, and started to question _everything_. Thankfully, if I've learned anything from programming, it's that when you don't know the answer, ask a search engine. That's exactly what I did. I asked searched how to be introspective and this is what I came up with.

First, [this article listing 4 simple steps to boost self-awareness](https://medium.com/behavior-design/here-are-the-4-simple-introspection-steps-that-will-boost-self-awareness-4be256bbf70a) listed some good steps. One thing I liked in particular was the advice to take 15 minutes at the beginning of your day to reflect inward. Yes, 'reflect inward' sounds nonsensical, I agree. We're on the same page, but let's just go with it. One thing I know about myself is that TODO lists make me equal parts excited and depressed. I love to make them than feel like a failure when I fail to complete them. Instead of making a TODO list and adding 'inward reflection', I decided to start some daily habits to instill. I will wake up and take 30 minutes to care for myself. I will meditate for 15 then grab a glass of water and reflect my innards. 

Another tip that article had was to not ask 'why' questions. As problem solvers these questions tend to make us jump to the most obvious answer. This is likely not the answer we are looking for, young Padawan. Instead, we should look into what is making us feel the way we are feeling. Right before this part in the article it does say to not obsess. That's good because, I definitely would have. I like the idea of limiting this 'wat am I feeling' portion of the day to 15 minutes for this exact reason.

A second thing I know about my inwards is that I want instant gratification. With this in mind, I decided to search for 'introspective questions'. I liked [this article](https://positivepsychology.com/introspection-self-reflection/) because it was the first one and I didn't have to spend anymore time looking. There were a few that were just too easy to answer, like: 'What makes you happiest in life?' Answer: Niko, duh. Then there were some that I didn't want to touch with a 10' pole: 'How will I live, knowing I will die?' Not today, Satan. Here are the questions I decided to ask myself. Here's a window (mirror?) into my reflected inwards. Feel free to reflect yournwards.

1. I feel happiest in my skin when . . .

I make something that I am proud of. Something that looks good, works well and it useful. I also feel pretty 'happy in my skin' (that's so weird too, what's with these introspective phrases?) when I am able to make people laugh, smile, feel happy, and/or have fun. This comes easiest to me and I think it may be because I've gotten such a personal reward from it that I honed that skill the longest. The flip side of this is it truly bugs me when I can't do it and I also risk sacrificing my comfort to accomplish this. I also wonder if I do this so people enjoy being around me. So, does that mean it's not a happy skin coat? Hrm, let's not obsess. Positively, I really do feel happiest when I make people I like, respect, and care about happy.

2. What’s one topic you need to learn more about to help you live a more fulfilling life? (Then, follow through and learn more about that topic.)

Myself. Oh no, infinite looooop!

3. I feel most energized when . . .

I'm around people. I'm not supposed to be thinking negatively (that was in the first article I listed) buuuuut, I wonder if it's like how performers hype themselves up to put on a show. To think of a more positive energizing situation, when I code and I start to see a project take shape, code works, etc. I get really pumped. It's hard for me to stop working because I can't wait to make more things work. 

4. Using 10 words, describe yourself.

- Empathetic
- Friendly
- Energetic
- Creative
- Funny
- Smart
- Innovative
- Caring
- Stubborn
- Prideful

I thought it would be hard to do this part, and it was. Starting out I immediately decided I would think of positive things. After 'funny' I realized two things: I was thinking of how others would describe me and these were not the words I would have preferred to be described as. I _do_ like empathetic, creative and funny and I do think I am these things. I _want_ to be described as smart and innovative but I stalled when writing those words down. That did not feel good. I decided they did apply to me. I also decided that although my stubbornness and pridefulness could be hindrances they were definitely good words to describe me. Moving on!

5. Write about a time when your work felt real, necessary and satisfying to you, whether the work was paid or unpaid, professional or domestic, physical or mental.

Doing the volunteer work for Americorps NCCC felt the most real, necessary and satisfying. I was tutoring children at after school programs, organizing volunteers in disaster-stricken areas, and gutting flooded houses after Hurricane Katrina. Hands down this felt the most necessary.

6. What do you love about life?

I love people and animals. I love when good people to good things for other good people. I love when animals get treated well. I love the good. That seems so simple. I love when people are able to good lives and share those good lives with people they love. I love happy times with people I love. I love love and laughter.

7. What worries me most about the future?

In reflecting on this, I realized that I don't worry too often. I'm very fortunate to have a healthy family, a great job and security in every way. Death. Death worries me the most; not my death. Sickness or the death of any of the people worries me the most. Just thinking about it makes me want to cry. I can't change this. I now hate this question.

Whelp, guess that's the end of the questions.

The last thing I decided to do was try just one of the thought exercises. This was the prompt:
>For this exercise, you need only to do one thing: Consider what you don’t know.

I don't know what my life will look like in 5 years. I always think that I want to avoid management positions but I have never been a manager (besides PacSun for that one year). So, I don't know if I should, in fact, avoid being a manager. Huh, I actually don't know what kind of options I have for my future career. I've never taken much time to research career paths. When thinking of careers I always just thought, 'there are people on the teams doing the work and there are the people that manage them.' I don't know what kind of salary I want to have in 5 years. That's probably a good thing to consider too.

I think these thought experiments helped already! It made me look deeper into the way I interact with people, made me consider what I think necessary work looks like, and realize what things I should look into more. One of my big takeaways is that I like having a positive impact on people's and animals' welfare. I do think I would like to do this by creating technology that helps them. I get energy from building out projects and I get happy skin from making people I care about happy. These things seems to fit together. Now, how do I make a career of that.

To be continued.
